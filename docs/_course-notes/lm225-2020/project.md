Brining everything together into a final project

<!--more-->

## Prep for this week's class

You should have attended all previous lessons and completed all assignments. 
You can use time in these weeks to complete assignments, but you will also need this time to work on your project â€“ you will have to find extra time to work independently.


## Assignment



### What do I need to do to pass? (40%)

Develop, plan and execute a final project that integrates skills, tools and processes from across the module.

Your project should be a physical thing that shows off your skills using digital fabrication methods, including:
* 2D and 3D design software
* 2D fabrication tools such as the laser cutter or milling machine
* 3D fabrication tools such as the 3D printer or milling machine
* Interactive technology or electronics such as lights, sensors, Arduinos or microcontrollers.

Document all your work on your student blog, showing your progress each week (1 week per page for 4 weeks minumum).

Include your original project proposal including sketches, diagrams, mood boards or examples of similar work.







with photos and videos to show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it. Cite external sources where you have used someone else's work.

### Extra credit (50-100%)
