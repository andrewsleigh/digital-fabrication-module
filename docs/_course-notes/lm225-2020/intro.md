## Introductions

## Assessment

Philosophy of documentation
"Document all your work on your student blog, with photos and videos to show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it. Cite external sources where you have used someone else’s work."


Not what you make, but how you document

Lab notes, not a report for me (a bit artificial) but I try to align what you need to get a good grade, with what is useful for you
