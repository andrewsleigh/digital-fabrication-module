## Assignment
- create a cad model of a 100x100mm tile (max height 20mm)  and save it as .stl file (with appropriate resolution based on 0.1mm layer height)

### What do I need to do to pass?
- submit a .stl file of a tile (or other small part) that you have designed

### Extra credit 
- scan a physical object (e.g. computer mouse)
- tidy up the scanned mesh in meshmixer
- use a cad package (e.g. Rhino, Fusion) to project curves onto the scanned mesh to create tidy cad geometry
- save as .stl file and submit

### For the super keen
- create a cad model of a part that can not made using any other single technology (subtractive, casting, moulding)
- submit this .stl file for printing
