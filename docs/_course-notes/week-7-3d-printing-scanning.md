Introducing 3D printing and scanning.

<!--more-->


## Prep for this week's class

Watch the corresponding Fab Academy lecture. We'll be covering part of this content. 

* Fab Academy lecture notes: <http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html>  
* [Lecture from 2018](http://fab.academany.org/2018/lectures/fab-20180221.html)

## Baseline 

Who has:

* 3d printed something?
* laser scanned something?

    *   typical process: edit>transform(rotate), close cracks, analysis>inspector,smooth, plane-cut, edit>make solid. Have a play!
    *   note: can also bring mesh into Rhino, use 'project curves' to create profile curves on the mesh, then use these to create Rhino surfaces that are better quality than the smoothed mesh. You can also add CAD into the mesh (e.g. scroll wheel) to add extra detail. Have a play!

# 3D printing

## Assignment
- design 50x50x5mm tile in CAD (max height 20mm) making sure you apply appropriate design rules. Save your model as .stl file (with appropriate resolution based on 0.1mm layer height). Submit your .stl file to the assessment area in this module on Studentcentral by 5pm on Friday 29th March and we will print this over easter. 
- load your .stl file into the Ultimaker Cura software and animate the printing process (layer view, press play!). Record this using a screen recorder or on your phone and embed the video onto your blog. 

### What do I need to do to pass?
- submit a .stl file of a tile (or other small part) that you have designed and include this into your blog. 

### Extra credit 
- scan a physical object (e.g. computer mouse)
- tidy up the scanned mesh in meshmixer
- use a cad package (e.g. Rhino, Fusion) to project curves onto the scanned mesh to create tidy cad geometry
- save as .stl file and submit

### For the super keen
- create a cad model of a part that can not made using any other single technology (subtractive, casting, moulding). OR create a design of an object that can be cleverly made/assembled without support material. 
- submit this .stl file for printing
