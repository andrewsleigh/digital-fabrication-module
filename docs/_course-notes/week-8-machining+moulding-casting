## Baseline 

Who has:

* done any workshop machining or CNC machining?
* made a mould?
* done any casting?

## Resources (computer-controlled machining)
- [CNC design guide](https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/how-design-parts-cnc-machining)

## Computer-controlled machining

### Our machines
- office (Des): 1610 3-axis router, 160x100x45mm (XYZ)
- E28 (Gary/Jon): Imes-Icore M40 3-axis router, 1000x900x250mm (XYZ)
- EM13 (Des): Roland MX-50 milling machine, 400x350x150mm (XYZ)
- E19 (Adam Cable): Herco VM10UI 5-axis milling machine, 400x400x400mm (XYZ)
- plasma 


### CAM software
- Solidworks CAM
- SolidCAM , demo , tutorials,  machine building (see simulation below)
- Fusion 360
- SRP player (Roland MX-50)
- fabmodules.org
- fabmods (http://mods.cba.mit.edu/)

### software to run CNC
- GRBL control (1610)
- ??? (Imes-Icore M40)
- swift cut (plasma)
- VPanel (Roland MX-50)
- Winmax (Herco VM10UI)

- VCarvePro (AXYZ)
- Marlin 
- Mach3

### hardware to run CNC
- pololu
- arduino

### tooling
- drill bits vs router bits vs end mills
- flutes
- coatings
- center-cutting
- up/down cut
- flat/ball end
   
- milling bit types: ball-nose, flat-end mills

### speeds n feeds
- chip load: ~ 0.001-0.010"
- feed rate (inches per minute) / (RPM x number of flutes) 
- cut depth: ~ tool diameter
- step-over: ~ tool diameter/2

### process
- CAD > CAM: generate toolpath + export G-code > load into machine software > run machine

## CNC rules
1. Vertical walls should have [draft angles](https://www.dynacast.com/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/97f5240f1f1a61eac4d6f431cbd0b2d4/files/diecasting_design_tips_01.jpg)
2. There should be no [undercuts](http://www.acomold.com/image/molding-undercuts.jpg)

## Resources (moulding&casting)

## Assignment
- create a 30x30x5 mini tile part in Fusion 360 and generate the toolpath to cut it out of a solid block 50x50x10mm using a 3mm flat end mill (ensure > 3deg of draft angle on all vertical surfaces)

## Extra credit
- cut the tile from the solid block of 50x50x10mm foam or wax using a CNC milling machine
- cast an elastic material (e.g. silicone or jelly) into the cavity and wait for this to set
- remove the new elastic mould tool
- cast a molten liquid (e.g. resin or chocolate) into your mould tool to create a solid part

### What do I need to do to pass?
- create the cad model of your tile and generate the toolpath.
???- vacuum form over a small part to create a mould, and cast something into the mould
