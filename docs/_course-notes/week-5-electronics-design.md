## Components
### Wire
Ribbon cable used for ISP headers - and post-milling board edits – [picture]({{ site.baseurl }}../assets/ribbon-wire.jpg)  
Also, headers (mechanical convenience)

### Buttons

Surface mount versions for circuits – [picture]({{ site.baseurl }}../assets/button.jpg)  
Momentary buttons - “N.O.” make a circuit when pressed (example use: connect a chip's reset pin to GND)  
You might want to use [cool buttons](http://blog.presentandcorrect.com/27986-2) for UI elements – [picture]({{ site.baseurl }}../assets/68426c45c8b5.jpg)

### Resistors

* Value measured in Ohms (1 Ohm, 5 kOhm, 4k7 Ohm, etc.)
* Limit the flow of current
* Ohm’s law: I = V/R

[Symbol]({{ site.baseurl }}../assets/resistor-symbol.png)

Uses often include:
* Regulate current to LEDs – [picture]({{ site.baseurl }}../assets/resistor-circuit.PNG)
* Keep pins high or low (pull-up/pull-down) without current flowing

Sizes: 
* We use 1206 (0.**12**”× 0.**06**”) 
* Hand solderable
* You can get a trace between the two ends

More: [Resistors - learn.sparkfun.com](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/resistors/all)

### Capacitors

Store charge, and release it when the voltage across the cap reaches a specific level  
Q (charge stored) = C (capacitance) x V (voltage across plates)  
Value of capacitance (amount of charge it can store): Farad (F, nF, pF, uF, etc.)

[Symbol]({{ site.baseurl }}../assets/capacitors.png)

Uses:
* Filtering high-frequency noise from ICs (“decoupling” or “bypass” capacitors)
* Supplying current to IC pins very quickly (e.g. when you ask it to switch on and off in your program)
* Create pulses at specific time intervals (with resistors)

Sizes:
* 1206 SMD 
* Bigger capacitors often polarised

More: <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/capacitors>

### Crystals and resonators

Used to tell time.   
Crystals are very accurate, but need 2 capacitors.  
Resonators are more convenient, but less accurate (could cause problems for your IC, e.g. for fast serial comms).  
IMHO: crystals are easier to solder, even with caps

Uses:
* External clock for microcontroller (IC)

### Diodes

Conducts only in one direction (as shown in circuit symbol)  
Current flows from anode (+) to cathode (-) (alphabetical)

[Symbol]({{ site.baseurl }}../assets/diode.PNG)


Uses: 
* Prevent current going in the wrong direction (e.g. if you connect a battery backwards)
* Often used in AC/DC convertors  

Types:
* Signal diode
* Specialised: Schottkey diode, Zener diode 
* LED: emits light and happiness

Diodes are polarised: bar on the symbol is the same as on the package (cathode)  
Diodes have no internal resistance, so can draw all the current available, and blow up  
So use a current-limiting resistor (e.g. 100 Ohm, 1K Ohm) - very common with LEDs


<!-- 
### Transistors

MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor)
Used to switch current in high power applications

Regulators
Turn a variable voltage into a fixed one (e.g. 5V for your IC)
Dissipate heat 

Op Amp 
Amplify current or voltage
Mostly now built into microcontrollers
 -->

### Microcontrollers

A whole circuit inside one package: a computer, analogy to digital convertors, clock, PWM outputs, memory, switches, etc, etc.

We’ll mostly use ones from Atmel: 

* ATtiny 44/45, 84/85
* ATmega 328p (Arduino Uno)
* ATmega 32u4 (Arduino Leonardo, USB)

Datasheets - learn to love them! 


And many more ...

## Drawing circuits
### Overview of Eagle

**See the [Detailed guide]({{ site.baseurl }}guide-draw-circuit-in-eagle) for more Eagle tips.**


#### Libraries of parts
Part: e.g. a 10k resistor  
Package: surface mount or through hole, size, etc.  
Specs: current it can handle, accuracy, etc.  
Libraries handle all this for you.

![eagle-library.png]({{ "/assets/eagle-library.png" | relative_url }})


#### Schematic
Logical structure of a circuit.  
How are the components connected.  
Abstract, not a visual representation.

![eagle-schematic.png]({{ "/assets/eagle-schematic.png" | relative_url }})

My schematic for Hello World board.  
Green lines show connections between parts.  
Parts are in red - notice chip doesn’t look like that.   
Once you’ve got used to Eagle, its easier to connect points by names instead of lines.


#### Board layout

Where the components go on the board, and how to route traces (connections between parts) between them.  
How to satisfy the requirements of the schematic, within the constraints of the fab process (aka design rules).  
Mainly: how thin can traces be, how close together can they be.  

![eagle-board-layout.png]({{ "/assets/eagle-board-layout.png" | relative_url }})


This *is* a visual representation. 



#### Export traces and outline

Eagle can generate a layered vector file of traced, pads, labels, and board outline.
Use your preferred tools to convert these into 2 PNG files for milling.


![eagle-to-png2.png]({{ "/assets/eagle-to-png3.png" | relative_url }})



#### Verify

* Total size of board
* Pitch of pins on parts
* Interference between parts
* Scaling mistakes
* Access to ports


![IMG_0235.jpg]({{ "/assets/IMG_0235.jpg" | relative_url }})

You will make mistakes.  
Start again.

**See the [Detailed guide]({{ site.baseurl }}guide-draw-circuit-in-eagle) for more Eagle tips.**

## Testing

* Multimeter - check for continuity or shorts.  
* Oscilloscope - measure voltage over time, see what signals pins are sending.
* Try to program.

## Assignment

<span class="wip">WIP: explanation of each component (about 1m06s in video)</span>

<span class="wip">WIP: maybe redraw this with additional components added already</span>

### 1) Redraw the Hello World board, starting with [Neil’s circuit](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/hello.ftdi.44.png):

![hello.ftdi.44.png]({{ "/assets/hello.ftdi.44.png" | relative_url }})

* Use a library in Eagle to get all these parts (look at the part bins here to see what we have).  
* Draw a schematic and board layout.  
* Export a millable png file of the traces and outline.
* How compact can you make it? ( = less waste, less milling time)

### 2) Make the board

If you have time, mill and stuff the board.  
_Do this if at all possible!_

### 3) Upload a pre-written program to the board to test that it works

<span class="wip">WIP: It might be easier to leave this til next week. And do a whole week on programming</span>

* See the [board programming guide]({{ site.baseurl }}guide-board-programming).
* If you’ve added a button and LED, you can try the standard Arduino blink sketch <span class="wip">WIP: see notes about testing</span>


### What do I need to do to pass?

Redraw the board without any additional components in Eagle and generate a PNG file suitable for milling.

Document all your work on your student blog, with photos and videos to show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it. Cite external sources where you have used someone else’s work.

### Extra credit 

Customise the board and then draw your custom version. e.g. Add a button and an LED (with current-limiting resistor) to PB2 and PB7. (Both of these go from the pin on the chip (which is high voltage, aka VCC) to GND.)

<span class="wip">WIP: may need to make this compulsory - or create a starter board with these comonents on, as it will be difficult to test otherwise</span>

Whether you've customised the board or not, mill and test the board by uploading a program.

Try uploading a C program to the board using command line tools
