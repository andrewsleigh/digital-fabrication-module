## Assignment ???
- laser cut a 30x30x5 mini tile part, then laser cut a trace to stick on top
- vacuum form a mould tool from your mini tile part
- cast in a molten liquid (e.g. chocolate!) into your mould tool to create a solid part

## Advanced Assignment
- create a 30x30x5 mini tile part in Fusion 360 and generate the toolpath to cut it out of a solid block 50x50x20 using a 3mm flat end mill (ensure > 3deg of draft on all vertical surfaces)
- cut the tile from the solid block using a CNC milling machine
- cast an elastic material (e.g. silicone) into the cavity and wait for this to set
- remove the new elastic mould tool
- cast a molten liquid (e.g. chocolate) into your mould tool to create a solid part

### What do I need to do to pass?
- create the cad model of your tile and generate the toolpath. OR...
???- vacuum form over a small part to create a mould, and cast something into the mould
