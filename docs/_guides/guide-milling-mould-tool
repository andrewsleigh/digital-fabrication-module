How to make your own open mould tool on the 1610 GRBL milling machine.

## 1. Starting point: a component in Fusion 360

## 2. Generate a tool path (CAD to CAM)

CAM software:  Fusion 360 again!

### CAM operations

You will probably need to go back several steps in the workflow here to address problems.

Typical problems:
* Traces and pads merging 
* Traces running underneath components

Fixes:
* Move components in the board layout 
* Reduce pad sizes (don’t change pitch!)
* Use a different milling bit
* Lie to the machine about which milling bit you're using

**Save**  
Once it’s working, hit save to generate RML file.
(A similar process to generate RML file for cutting outline.)
Save the rml file somewhere you can find it.
Rml looks like this; very simple instructions:

```
PA;PA;VS4;!VZ4;!PZ0,200;!MC1;
PU350,4075;
Z350,4075,-10;
Z304,4077,-10;
Z276,4097,-10;
Z262,4129,-10;
Z264,4167,-10;
Z282,4193,-10;
Z306,4207,-10;
Z336,4211,-10;
...
```

## 3. Set up the milling machine ([docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14R-S-bQIisVIhJUZ70ZwEbi74LaQbHa-e2ixB39OMN8/edit#))

**Safety**
- this is an exposed machine and can cause serious harm
- everyone must be trained by a member of staff in order to use the machine
- never use the machine alone
- never leave the machine running unattended
- safety guard must be put on the machine before it is started up

**Prepare bed and material**

* Sacrifical material  
* Must be flat and clean  
* With a marker, draw two lines from corner to corner on the top of your workpiece to get the center

**Place stock on bed**

* Double-sided tape on the bottom of your stock
* Place your part approximately in the middle of the bed (our object is small: there's plenty of space so no need to be perfect here)
* Don't tape your stock down yet!

**Select tool**

* Know what tool is (flat/ball-nose, 3mm diameter)
* Place it in the collet and nip it up tight with the allen key (attached to z-axis gantry)
* Check that the bit is centred by rotating the collet with your hand
* Plug the 1610 CNC mill into the mains (plug labelled 1610 CNC)

## 4. Back to the computer: Send your .nc file to the 1610 machine.

Load GRBLcontrol (on the desktop)
Open your .nc file in GRBLcontrol

![vpanel.png]({{ "/assets/vpanel.png" | relative_url }})

**Set x, y, z zero**
* Move x and y until it's above the centre mark
* Lower tool to surface until it touches the centre mark then set z0, and set xy0. Always spin the tool when setting z so you know when it's just touching
* Remove your stock from the bed
- Make sure everything is out of the way (e.g. cables, swarf)

## 5. Mill fresh air
- When you hit Send, the machine will start milling. Stand by and be ready to pause or abort in the software in case something goes wrong. 
- Keep an eye on what the machine does - is it doing what is expected?
- Keep an eye on things! 

## 6. Cut the tool
- place your stock on the board, taping it down onto the sacrificial layer
- again position the tool on the centre of the top of the workpiece and set z0 and xy0
- make sure your spindle speed is set at 1000 rpm
- if you're using low (blue or yellow) or medium (grey) density foam, then there's no need to over ride the speed of the machine (keep it at 100%)
- if you're using high density foam (pink), then you'll need to set the override to 75% before running the machin
- if you're using blue wax, then you'll need to set the override to 30% before running the machine
- then hit Send and the machine will start running again

- remember not to leave the machine running unattended - ever

* Similar process to cut outline. See [docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14R-S-bQIisVIhJUZ70ZwEbi74LaQbHa-e2ixB39OMN8/edit#) for more detail.

Ensure that you do not change the XY origin between the traces and outline jobs


## 7. Clean and check board

* Deburr board with abrasive sponge or wire wool
* Clean skin oils off copper
* Verify your traces look correct (clean, not shorting, right size)
