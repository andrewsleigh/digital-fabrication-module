## 3D Printer

Materials

## Constraints / Design rules

* Printing layer by layer / supports, overhangs
* Resolution
* Aesthetic limitations


Anti-constraints:
* Pre-assembled parts / mechanisms
* Programmatic customisation
* Affordable one-offs (no tooling)

*   [design rules](https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/key-design-considerations-3d-printing)

## Workflow

### 1. CAD

Design your 3D model and save as an `.STL` file

Software:
* Fusion 360
* Solidworks

Or download a model as STL (e.g. Thingiverse)

### 2. Slice

* 'Slice' the model into layers to generate tools paths.
* Configure settings for your printer and model
* Save file as `.GCODE` onto SD card

Software: 
* Cura


*   good software: [simplify3d](https://www.simplify3d.com/) to slice the stls <span style="font-size: 13px;">and</span> create <span style="font-size: 13px;">the</span> gcode<span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span>
*  free software to generate toolpath for 3D printers (can animate in layer view): [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/51943-installation-ultimaker-cura). And [here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvUmeJ3r58A) showing how to view the layers and toopath in cura. 


### 3. Print
* Load filament into printer
* Check bed 
* Print file from SD card
* Monitor while printing, especially first few layers. Be careful of tall models with overhangs


### 4. (Repeat)

* What worked, what didn't?
* Do you need to change your design, or just your print settings?

### 5. Finishing / Assembly

Often much easier to print a model in 2 parts and assemble

[**3D printing**](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html "3d printing")

*   is an exciting new area [making lots of interesting things](https://www.google.com/search?q=3d+printing+examples&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfxeWJwf3gAhU0XRUIHVC1BgsQ_AUIDigB&biw=1420&bih=697) but the hype is too much!
*   is additive manufacturing, like lego!
*   requires [support material (in most cases)](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1420&bih=697&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=ah-IXIzqFoPRrgTwx6mwCA&q=3d+printing+support+material&oq=3d+printing+support+material&gs_l=img.3..0j0i24l3.74515.76108..76253...0.0..0.189.1550.13j4......1....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i67j0i8i30j0i30.7EnP8jt2LP4)
*   creates inherent weaknesses [or variable properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29904165) between layers of parts
*   the challenge is creating/using [design tools](http://eprints.brighton.ac.uk/14489/1/template_CGIconf_CameraReadyFINAL.pdf) to support the geometric freedom 3DP affords - there are no straight lines in nature!
*   our 3DP centre in AEB mostly prints in ABS/PLA/flexible
