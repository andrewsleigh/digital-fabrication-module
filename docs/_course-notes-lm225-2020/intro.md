## Prep for this week

### Your presentation



### Your computer with software

It will be very helpful to have a **laptop** you can bring to the class. There are some desktop PCs available, but you will find it a lot more difficult to work. 

We will be using a lot of new software. **You must install and verify software before coming to the lectures.** Some software requires a free educational licence, which may take some time to be provided. Minimum requirements:

* 2D: Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator
* 3D: Autodesk Fusion 360, Ultimaker Cura
* Web publishing: :construction:

Helpful: 
* Image editor: Adobe Photoshop
* Video editor (Premiere, iMovie, Final Cut Pro, etc.)
* Photo editor that offers compression settings (Apple Photos, Adobe Photoshop)



## Digital Fabrication

What is it
Interesting examples
Culture and technology

Inspire students/frame course in terms of outcomes
This is how you can apply this:
 - 3d fabrics that bend with water or 3D printed parts
 - defensive clothing that inflates etc
 - see FA archives for textiles projects (or fabricademy)	


## The course

Aims
Difficulty
Time/Project management

Co-ordinating between yourselves, time in the lab (can take a machine 2 hours to do something)
Catch-up weeks



## Introductions

Inc me!


## Assessment

Philosophy of documentation
"Document all your work on your student blog, with photos and videos to show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it. Cite external sources where you have used someone else’s work."


Not what you make, but how you document

Lab notes, not a report for me (a bit artificial) but I try to align what you need to get a good grade, with what is useful for you
