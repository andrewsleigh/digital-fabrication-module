About this course, what we'll cover, how we'll learn, and how it will be assessed. 

<!--more-->

## Prep for this week

### 1. Prepare a presentation
To help us get to know one another, and to help me tailor content on the course to your interests, I would like each of you to **prepare a short (2-3 minute) presentation about yourselves**.

* Tell us who you are, and what you're interested in making (in this module or more broadly)
* Bring something you've made (on your course, or not), and talk about how and why you made it
* I'd like to know what you think you might be able to do with 'digital fabrication' if you have any ideas!

You don't need to make slides or show anything on screen.

### 2. Find out something about digital fabrication or fab labs 

This course will all make a lot more sense if you know something about *fab labs*. Start by watching this video:
<https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_gershenfeld_unleash_your_creativity_in_a_fab_lab>

If the first bit is too bewildering, you could start at about 6 minutes in: <https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_gershenfeld_unleash_your_creativity_in_a_fab_lab/transcript?language=en#t-351107> Don't worry, we will not be "functionalizing nanoclusters"!

There are some more suggestions on reading/watching here: <https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/handbook#other-useful-resources>


## Setup

:speech_balloon: Register, name badges

## Digital Fabrication

What is it?

* Small batch production
* Rapid prototyping
* Customisation
* Distributed manufacturing

Examples: <https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/examples>


## The lab

Tour!

* Machines
* Materials
* What you can make
* Safety


## Introductions 

Max 3 mins each.  
:speech_balloon: Timer

* Tell us who you are, and what you're interested in making (in this module or more broadly)
* Show something you've made (on your course, or not), and talk about how and why you made it

:speech_balloon: Including me!

## The course

Review the handbook: <https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/handbook>

Notes:

* Difficulty
* Time/Project management
* Assessment vs documentation (more later)
* Machine time (slow, not magic)
* Catch-up weeks
* Your access - do you have computing labs at GP you can use?

## This week: Documenting your work

An overview to documentation and websites, and where to find out more:

## Why?

:construction:

[Craft is a science](https://faberfutures.com/projects/the-ginkgo-creative-residency/) 
* Got to keep notes (when you do it, and when you come back to repeat it)		
* Offload your brain – you will forget

Helps you learn (Lifelong Kindergarten [Creative Learning Spiral](https://medium.com/@mres/ten-tips-for-cultivating-creativity-fe79e7ebb83e))

* Shows how learners construct knowledge through making
* Sharing is an important part of that spiral
  * forces you to look at it from another angle - someone else
  * verifies that you actually understand it and helps you identify the bits you don’t
	* Feynman: “If you can’t explain it simply…”

Get noticed ([Laura Kampf](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRix1GJvSBNDpEFY561eSzw/featured))

* Other people use your work, building on it
* Projects with good documentation get take-up from others	
* Projects that invite people in help cultivate a community around your work
* (And if you’re daunted by these successful people, look at their early work.)



## How?

### Website architectures

* CMS: [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com), [Edublogs](http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk)
* Self-hosting: [domains](https://www.tsohost.com/domain-names), [hosting](https://www.tsohost.com/web-hosting), [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org), [FTP](https://www.wired.com/2010/02/ftp_for_beginners/)
* HTML: view-source, [tutorials](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/) 
* Flat file sites: Jekyll, [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages)
* Platforms / embedding media: YouTube, [STL](https://github.com/lorennorman/octocat-3d/blob/master/stl/octocat_head.stl), Codepen 
* [The open web vs walled gardens](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/10/1301496/) / owning your stuff (self-hosting vs domain pointing)

### Software

* Text editor: Atom (not Word!)
* CMS: [Edublogs](http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk)
* Image editor ([handbook](https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/handbook#things-you-will-need))
* Online tools (e.g. [image compression](https://compressor.io))


### A/V media

* Product photography
* Compression / formats
* Video / hosting

* [Edublogs guide](http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk)
* [Image Optimization](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization)


## Assignment

Build a website for the module using Edublogs or another platform of your choice.

* Include a page about yourself that covers the material of your presentation
* Include a photo of yourself and the thing you've already made
* Add a page for this week and cover what you've learned about publishing on the web: show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it.

Submit the URL to Student Central through Turnitin.


### What do I need to do to pass? (40%)

:speech_balloon: Explain these grade boundaries.

* A working website with: 
  * An 'about' page 
  * A page for this week

### Extra credit (50-100%)

* If you're using Edublogs, customise the site design
* Review and test alternative platforms/architectures: document how you choose a platform to use
* Use an external hosting service that will serve you throughout your studies (and perhaps into professional life)
* Register a domain and point it to your site

## For next week

We'll be using the laser cutter.

* Read the [course notes](https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/2d-laser)
* Install and try out some 2D vector software ([handbook](https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/handbook#things-you-will-need))
* Learn about vectors vs pixels and bezier curves (no links provided!)
