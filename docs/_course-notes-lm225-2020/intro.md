About this course, what we'll cover, how we'll learn, and how it will be assessed. 

<!--more-->

## Prep for this week

### 1. Prepare a presentation
To help us get to know one another, and to help me tailor content on the course to your interests, I would like each of you to **prepare a short (2-3 minute) presentation about yourselves**.

* Tell us who you are, and what you're interested in making (in this module or more broadly)
* Bring something you've made (on your course, or not), and talk about how and why you made it
* I'd like to know what you think you might be able to do with 'digital fabrication' if you have any ideas!

You don't need to make slides or show anything on screen.

### 2. Find out something about digital fabrication or fab labs 

This course will all make a lot more sense if you know something about *fab labs*. Start by watching this video:
<https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_gershenfeld_unleash_your_creativity_in_a_fab_lab>

If the first bit is too bewildering, you could start at about 6 minutes in: <https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_gershenfeld_unleash_your_creativity_in_a_fab_lab/transcript?language=en#t-351107> Don't worry, we will not be "functionalizing nanoclusters"!

There are some more suggestions on reading/watching here: <https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/handbook#other-useful-resources>

## Digital Fabrication

What is it
Interesting examples / possible outcomes :construction:

 - 3d fabrics that bend with water or 3D printed parts
 - defensive clothing that inflates etc
 - see FA archives for textiles projects (or fabricademy)	

 

## The lab

Tour!

* Machines
* Materials
* What you can make


## Introductions 

Max 3 mins each.  
:speech_balloon: Timer

* Tell us who you are, and what you're interested in making (in this module or more broadly)
* Show something you've made (on your course, or not), and talk about how and why you made it

:speech_balloon: Including me!

## The course

Review the handbook: <https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/handbook>

Notes:

* Difficulty
* Time/Project management
* Philosophy of documentation
* Machine time (slow!)
* Catch-up weeks
* Your access - do you have computing labs at GP you can use?

## This week: Documenting your work


An overview to documentation and websites, and where to find out more

:construction:

### Website architectures

* CMS
* Self-hosting: domains
* HTML
* Flat file sites
* Platforms / embedding media
* The open web / owning your stuff

### Software

* Text editor
* CMS
* Image editor
* Online tools (e.g. image compression)


### A/V media

Product photography
Compression / formats
Video / hosting


## Reading/Watching

:construction:

## Assignment

Build a website for the module using Edublogs or another platform of your choice.

* Include a page about yourself that covers the material of your presentation
* Include a photo of yourself and the thing you've already made
* Add a page for this week and cover what you've learned about publishing on the web: show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it.

Submit the URL to Student Central :construction:


### What do I need to do to pass? (40%)

:speech_balloon: Explain these grade boundaries

* A working website with: 
  * An 'about' page 
  * A page for this week

### Extra credit (50-100%)

* If you're using Edublogs, customise the site design
* Review and test alternative platforms: document how you choose a platform to use
* Use an external hosting service that will serve you throughout your studies (and perhaps into professional life)
* Register a domain and point it to your site
