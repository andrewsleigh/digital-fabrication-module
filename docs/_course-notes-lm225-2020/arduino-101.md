From zero to blinking LEDs with Arduino

<!--more-->

## Aims for class

* A brief intro to Arduino, was it does and how it relates to other technologies that ‘do stuff’
* Get everyone from zero to getting your Arduino hooked up and talking to your computer, and a program running
* A bit of hacking of code that other people have written
* If we have time, we’ll look at how we might build some of the prototypes you want to make



## Microcontrollers and embedded programming

Development boards and microcontrollers
What’s in a microcontroller
How do we access it
What are all the bits on an Arduino



## What is a microcontroller?

Microcontroller vs Microprocessor  
Simpler computer  
Has lots of ‘peripherals’ inside - see block diagram  
Microprocessor is what’s inside your computer - needs lots of external parts to make it work: RAM, GPU, disk, etc.

## What’s inside a microcontroller?

ATtiny Block Diagram:

![ATtiny-Block-Diagram.png]({{ "/assets/ATtiny-Block-Diagram.png" | relative_url }})

Capabilities:
* Tell time / keep time
* Remember data
* Read analogue signals from the outside world
* Talk to other microcontrollers
* Send and control power out to other devices


## How can we access these capabilities?

Through the pins. 

Pinout diagrams are your friend.

Pinout for ATtiny (as above)

Pinout for ATmega 328p (as used in Arduino Uno): <https://www.circuito.io/blog/arduino-uno-pinout/>

## What is "Arduino"?


### 1. A board (or family of boards)

From: <https://learn.adafruit.com/ladyadas-learn-arduino-lesson-number-0?view=all>

Yours might look different (e.g. SMD chip)


### 2. An IDE (desktop or web)

![]({{ "/assets/arduino-ide.png" | relative_url }})


* Text editor
* Console and serial port monitor
* Bundled tools for compiling code and uploading it to the Arduino (avr-gcc)
* Bundled examples, board definitions etc.

### 3. A library for C/C++

You're writing C code, and taking advantage of *libraries* written to make controlling an Arduino easier:

```
void loop() {                       // Defining a function in C
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // Using Arduino library functions 
  delay(2000);                      
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   
  delay(1000);                      
}
```

### 4. An open source community

* Designed for artists and other non-engineers. Newbie-friendly.
* Open Source (Eg Creality printer)
* Tutorials, answers online: Google first!
* Clone boards and compatible tech, e.g. add-on ‘shields’
* Variants - eg micro sew-on boards, DIY boards
* Pathways to other platforms: ESP8266, Arm, Bela, Pi, Processing


## Getting started

Download, install and verify the Arduino IDE software for your computer:
<https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software>

If you want to use the web editor, you must create an account and install the plugin first:
<https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/getting-started-with-arduino-web-editor-on-various-platforms-4b3e4a>

## Hacking code


* You don't need to start from scratch!
* Everyone learns by hacking other people's code – but credit your sources.
* Arduino comes with simple examples for many common tasks (File > Examples)
* There are libraries for many more (reading an SD card, playing MP3s, controlling stepper motors)
* There are code examples everywhere on the web



### Example sketch: Blink

```
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
```

### Open the sketch

Examples > 01. Basics > Blink

### Install drivers if you need to 

(often for clone boards with a CP210x USB chip): <https://learn.adafruit.com/ladyadas-learn-arduino-lesson-number-0?view=all#install-drivers-if-not-using-arduino-uno-16-9>

### Plug board into computer with USB cable

### Select the Board and Port in Arduino IDE

Tools > Board > (for most of you, "Arduino/Genuino Uno")
Tools > Port > (varies by platform)

e.g. 
* Mac: `/dev/cu.usbmodemxxxx`
* Windows: `Arduino UNO (COMxx)`

See: <https://learn.adafruit.com/ladyadas-learn-arduino-lesson-number-0?view=all#find-your-serial-com-port-15-26>

### Upload!

Sketch > Upload  
Or right arrow on toolbar

### It will often go wrong!

* Look at the messages in the console
* Check everything is connected
* Check you have the right board and port selected
* Try a different USB port, dongle or cable

## Power

* Via USB from computer
* Via USB from 5V wall adapter / phone charger
* Via 12V barrel jack
* Via LiPo battery, or portable USB battery pack
