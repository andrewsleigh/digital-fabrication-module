Generating artwork for the laser cutter. Designing for 2D (and 3D).

<!--more-->

## Prep for this week's class

## Baseline 



## Advanced laser cutter
 
### Applications

* Cutting or marking/engraving by varying power  
* Raster or [vector](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/gray.jpg) mode
* Screen printing, by making a [halftone](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/halftone.jpg) (See [holes](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/holes.jpg), [path](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/halftone.png)) 
* Press-fit construction (example: [GIK](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/gik.jpg), [gik.cad](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/gik.cad), [gik.png](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/gik.png))

## Joints

[Examples](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/joints.jpg)

Easy to design \<--> Strongest properties

* Slot - simplest, hard to align
* Chamfer - rounded corners help align parts, and can compress materials into slots (eg corrugated cardboard). But still relies on sliding friction
* Bistable (bump and slot), behaves very differetly for different materials
* Flexure - design a bendable part with controllable flex
* Pinned - secure joint with an orthogonal constraint (see also [wedged mortise and tenon](https://www.canadianwoodworking.com/tipstechniques/wedged-mortise-tenon))

### Tolerances 

* Slop vs security (range is about 0.1mm)
* Brittle material vs compressible material
* Parametric design is your friend


### Kerf

Some material is removed with the cut.  
Some drivers (e.g. mods) allow for this, with offsetting.  
Otherwise, you should allow for this in your design (parametrically!)


## 3D shapes

* Kerfing (incomplete cut)
* [Flexures, living hinges](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/flexures.png) (enables twists and bends). See also [Inkscape living hinge extension](https://inkscape.org/~drphonon/★living-hinge-creator)
* Extreme example, a [moving platform](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/56836505.pdf) without moving parts (gears, bearings)


## Parametric design

* Cardboard comes in different thicknesses
* Lasers cut with different kerfs
* Human bodies come in different shapes and sizes

Inkscape is not parametric, Rhino and Fusion 360 are.

## Vectors vs Pixels

## File formats

Look inside an SVG

## CAD to CAM

Vectors to machine paths






## 3D assembly and forming shapes

Maybe go into this in more detail this week?


### 3D shapes
Living hinge
Scoring
Box nets
Combine 3D proccesses (deform stretched fabric)

### Assembly
Pins, laces
Clasps
Slots and tabs (post-couture)





## Software tools

Parametric design







## Assignment

Design your own assembly mechanism for making 3D objects out of a 2D material.

Design your parts in software, then test to see how they work by cutting them.
Iterate.


Document all your work on your student blog, with photos and videos to show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it. Cite external sources where you have used someone else's work.
