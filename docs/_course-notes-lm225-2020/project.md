Bringing everything together into a final project

<!--more-->

<!-- ## Prep for this week's class

You should have attended all previous lessons and completed all assignments. 
You can use time in these weeks to complete assignments, but you will also need this time to work on your project – you will have to find extra time to work independently. -->


## Assignment

Develop, plan and execute a final project that integrates skills, tools and processes from across the module.

Document all your work on your student blog, showing your progress each week (1 week per page for 4 weeks minumum).

## Coronavirus update: 2020-03-23

I've started to collect some project ideas and approaches better suited to a lockdown situation here:

[Lockdown Projects](lockdown-projects)

### What do I need to do to pass? (40%) 

2020-03-31 Updated for Coronavirus:

Try to integrate some different design and fabrication skills into one project. Ideally one or more of these should be digital, but you can combine this with non-digital processes and tools. 

You can also augment a non-digital project with a digital element, e.g. building a prototype with craft materials, and using CAD to render a visualisation of how it could look if digitally fabricated.

As with the other assignments, the assesment is based on the quality of your documentation, so try to:

* Set yourself – and state – a hypothesis to test: "Can I make this thing using this process?"
* Document what you did to test it
* Show your results and a plan for how to improve the next version
* Iterate

<!-- 
Your project should be a physical thing that shows off your skills using digital fabrication methods, including any of:
* 2D and 3D design software
* 2D fabrication tools such as the laser cutter or milling machine
* 3D fabrication tools such as the 3D printer or milling machine
* Interactive technology or electronics such as lights, sensors, Arduinos or microcontrollers. -->

Include a page on your original project proposal including sketches, diagrams, mood boards or examples of similar work.

Include a page on the end result with photographs of the final project, a description of what it is/does and a reflection on how it could be improved.




<!-- 

with photos and videos to show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it. -->

Cite external sources where you have used someone else's work. 

### Extra credit (50-100%)

Write up your project as a project that someone else could replicate. Publish it on Instructables, or other appropriate platform

Integrate more technologies to a greater degree of sophistication.

Show how prototyping has helped you develop a better final project.

Include videos, timelapses or other rich media to show off your final project or its development.
