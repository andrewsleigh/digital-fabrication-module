* CNC'd plywood bent to form 3D shape
* Used Rhino/Grasshopper
* Originally a lighting deisgn, now adapted for lightweight structures


### Memento Rug

* Laser cut wool felt rug
* 2D vector file
* Cut on the machine, but lots of hand finishing required
* High volume production uneconomical


### Archisuits

> Artist and researcher Sarah Ross’s Archisuits are a hilarious and pointed look at soft bodies in hard spaces—all the ways the built environment is a mismatch for human needs.

### Self-forming structures

> The main idea here is that we can make fabric take a specific 3-dimensional shape by printing different patterns of plastic onto it while stretched. The printed plastic inhibits the contraction of the surface, guiding it to take a shape upon release.
