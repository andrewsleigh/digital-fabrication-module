An introduction to Fusion 360 CAD (Computer Aided Design) software.

## Prep for this week's class

If you have a laptop, download and install Fusion 360, and create an Autodesk account to save your work in the cloud (you will then be able to use Fusion on any computer on which it's installed):

[Fusion 360 free education license](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators)

If you don't have a laptop, create a user account with Autodesk, and log into Fusion in a computing lab.

Familiarise yourself with the interface, or watch some [introductory videos](<https://www.linkedin.com/learning/fusion-360-essential-training-2/use-fusion-360-to-turn-your-ideas-into-designs?u=67552674>)


## Fusion 360

### Basic principles

Interface elements:
* Projects 
* Modelling area
* Tools
* View cube
* Browser
* History

Modelling by combining and adjusting olid forms: create complex shapes from primitive parts

![]({{ "/assets/fusion5-extrude.png" | relative_url }})

You can start by drawing 3D forms or *extruding* 2D sketches

![]({{ "/assets/fusion4-planes.png" | relative_url }})

Almost every operation starts from a specific plane, or face of an existing object.




**Task 1:** create two cubes (or simple 3D objects):
* by creating a 3D primitive directly
* by extruding a 2D sketch



*Bodies* are stored in a hierarchy of objects (including *sketches*, axes, bodies and *components*)

Operations are recorded in a project history and can be *suppressed*, deleted or modified at any time 


Design Philosophy

Workflow

Multiple ways to do something


Parametric

See Kobble table, or Polish furniture brand...

## Assignment

Model an existing object
e.g. 6-sided die, simple table

Extra credit:
Make it parametric and show how it varies
3D print or cast it (or a model of it)
