An introduction to Fusion 360 CAD (Computer Aided Design) software.

## Prep for this week's class

If you have a laptop, download and install Fusion 360, and create an Autodesk account to save your work in the cloud (you will then be able to use Fusion on any computer on which it's installed):

[Fusion 360 free education license](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators)

If you don't have a laptop, create a user account with Autodesk, and log into Fusion in a computing lab.

Familiarise yourself with the interface, or watch some [introductory videos](<https://www.linkedin.com/learning/fusion-360-essential-training-2/use-fusion-360-to-turn-your-ideas-into-designs?u=67552674>)


## Fusion 360

### Basic principles

Interface elements:
* Projects 
* Modelling area
* Tools
* View cube
* Browser
* History

![]({{ "/assets/fusion1-interface2.png" | relative_url }})

Modelling by combining and adjusting solid forms: create complex shapes from primitive parts

![]({{ "/assets/fusion2-3d-primitive.png" | relative_url }})

You can start by drawing 3D forms or *extruding* 2D sketches

![]({{ "/assets/fusion3-2d-sketch.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/assets/fusion5-extrude.png" | relative_url }})


Almost every operation starts from a specific plane, or face of an existing object.

![]({{ "/assets/fusion4-planes.png" | relative_url }})


**Task 1:** create two cubes (or simple 3D objects):
* by creating a 3D primitive directly
* by extruding a 2D sketch




*Bodies* are stored in a hierarchy of objects (including *sketches*, axes, bodies and *components*).

![]({{ "/assets/fusion-browser.png" | relative_url }})

Operations are recorded in a project history and can be *suppressed*, deleted or modified at any time. 

![]({{ "/assets/fusion-timeline.png" | relative_url }})

**Task 2:** remove a body from the browser, and edit another from the timeline

Bodies are independent and editable seperately until they are _joined_. (Don't join your bodies until you need to.)

![]({{ "/assets/fusion-create-new-body.png" | relative_url }})

Many things can be _moved_, including bodies, _faces_ and sketches. 

![]({{ "/assets/fusion-move.png" | relative_url }})

You can create patterns by copying instead of moving objects
There is also a pattern tool to quickly make complex repeaing patterns
(This can generate a lot of new objects!)


![]({{ "/assets/fusion-pattern.png" | relative_url }})


Use _Combine_ to join bodies together, or cut them away

![]({{ "/assets/fusion-combine.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/assets/fusion-combine-result.png" | relative_url }})


Working subtractively: punch holes, slice off faces

![]({{ "/assets/fusion-move-face.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/assets/fusion-cut.png" | relative_url }})

## Other useful tools

View cube
Visual style selector

Fillets and chamfers
Download components


Design Philosophy

Workflow

Multiple ways to do something


Parametric

See Kobble table, or Polish furniture brand...

## Assignment

Model an existing object
e.g. 6-sided die, simple table

Extra credit:
Make it parametric and show how it varies
3D print or cast it (or a model of it)
