Welcome to the module. What you need to do before the first class.

<!--more-->

Welcome to Digital Fabrication Methods, where we will learn 'how to make almost anything' using machines and computers!

I'm looking forward to meeting you all for our first session on 4th February. Before we meet, here is some information to help you prepare. Be aware, you will be asked to give a short presentation in the fist session, so please read and act on these notes.

## Where to find information

Everything in [this email](https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/prep), and all the [course notes](https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/readme), student handbook and [assessment information](https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/assessment) are on the course website here: 

<https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/readme>

Summary information will also be uploaded to Student Central, but be sure to check the website for the most uptodate information.

## Preparing for the first class

Course material for the first class is here: <https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/intro>. This page tells you **what you need to bring**. 


### 1. Prepare a presentation
To help us get to know one another, and to help me tailor content on the course to your interests, I would like each of you to **make a short (2-3 minute) presentation about yourselves**.

* Tell us who you are, and what you're interested in making (in this module or more broadly)
* Bring something you've made (on your course, or not), and talk about how and why you made it
* I'd like to know what you think you might be able to do with 'digital fabrication' if you have any ideas!

You don't need to make slides or show anything on screen.

### 2. Find out something about digital fabrication or fab labs 

This course will all make a lot more sense if you know something about *fab labs* Start by watching this video:

If the first bit is too bewildering, you could start at about 6 minutes in: <https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_gershenfeld_unleash_your_creativity_in_a_fab_lab/transcript?language=en#t-351107> Don't worry, we will not be "functionalizing nanoclusters"!

There are some more suggestions on reading/watching here: <https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/handbook#other-useful-resources>
