### Site structure



If you'd like to contribute, or use the content, most of the course content is located in the [`/docs`](https://github.com/andrewsleigh/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/docs) folder.

Course notes for each week are in [/docs/_course-notes](https://github.com/fablabbrighton/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/docs/_course-notes)

There are also folders for special projects and howto guides, such as:

* [/docs/_diy-arduino](https://github.com/fablabbrighton/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/docs/_diy-arduino) – experimenting with making a simple arduino board in the lab
* [/docs/_guides](https://github.com/fablabbrighton/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/docs/_guides) – howto guides for common processes in the lab
* [/docs/_colophon](https://github.com/fablabbrighton/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/docs/_colophon) – how the site is made

Design files and code examples are in their own folders at the root level: [`/3d-models`](https://github.com/fablabbrighton/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/3d-models), [`/arduino-code`](https://github.com/fablabbrighton/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/arduino-code), [`/board-designs`](https://github.com/fablabbrighton/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/board-designs), etc.
