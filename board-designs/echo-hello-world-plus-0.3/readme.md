This is a minimal ATtiny44-based board, derived from Neil's Echo Hello World board, as used in [Fab Academy Electronics Design week](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html)

It has an additional LED (with current-limiting resistor) and button, to enable simple testing by uploading Arduino blink or button sketches.

The button needs a pull-up resistor (on the pin, or added externally) to work.

This board is used in our [electronics design week](https://github.com/andrewsleigh/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/docs/_course-notes/week-5-electronics-design.md)
